# Task Manager App

A simple Task Manager application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Users can view, add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The app fetches initial tasks from a mocked API and manages state locally.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
